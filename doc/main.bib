	abstract = {There is a chronic lack of shared application domains to test the research models and agent architectures on areas like negotiation, argumentation, trust and reputation. In this demostration we introduce such a friendly testbed called dipGame that can be used for all such purposes. The testbed is based on the Diplomacy Game due to its lack of random moves and because of the essential role that negotiation and the relationships between the players play in the game. The testbed may also profit from the existence of a community of bot (player software agent) developers and a large number of human players that would provide data for experiments. We offer the infrastructure, including a bot, and make it freely available to the MAS community.},
